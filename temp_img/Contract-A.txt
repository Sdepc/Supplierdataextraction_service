'!V9:',:'l'l AS G3/\OHdclV    10.5 Individual and bulk packaging for shipping will be designed in accordance with  Cisco’s standard packaging procedures with consideration given to Rockwelrs drawing  number 957828D0~A01, which includes packaging and palletization requirements and  with changes to which both parties have agreed. The number of units per bulk or ﬂow  container will be deﬁned by both parties at a later date. Both parties will review and  approve ﬁnal packaging, which will be documented in Rockwe||’s Trading Goods  Document (TGD).    10.6 A standard Cisco and Rockwell pack-out label will be used that will contain the  Cisco Product ID. The serial number(s) of the product(s) in the box will be included on  the label outside of the box in both human readable and bar coded formats. The country  of origin will be identiﬁed on the outside labeling, as well.    10.7 No identiﬁcations with Cisco’s name or logo will appear on any individual carton of  the Switch Product shipped to Rockwell under this Agreement. A Cisco pack-out label  and packing slip will accompany each order in the over-pack materials.    10.8 Cisco agrees to indicate the Hardware revision on each Rockwell switch. Layout of  the labels will be done in accordance with a process to be agreed upon by both parties  prior to Cisco’s pre-pilot build.    10.9 The items identiﬁed above in this Section 10 are agreed to with respect to the  switches and spares identified in Section A and B of Exhibit D. For new SFPs identiﬁed  in Section C of Exhibit D, the current labeling, packaging requirements and process  already established for existing SF Ps will be followed.    11. Confidentialig. The obligations of each party with respect to Conﬁdential Information  disclosed under this Addendum are stated in Exhibit I of the Agreement, Supplement to  Master Non-Disclosure Agreement Between Cisco Systems, Inc. and Rockwell  Automation, (hereafter "NDA No. 115819"). In addition, Cisco shall retain as conﬁdential  all information associated with the Smartport and global macro conﬁgurations (i.e.  macros) listed in Section 2 of Exhibit B (Stratix 7000 Unique Features or Modiﬁcation),  and Section 6.2 of NDA No.115819 shall not apply to terminate Cisco’s conﬁdentiality  obligations with respect to the global macro and Smartport conﬁgurations.    12. Survival. Sections 1, 5, 8 and 11 and Exhibit B shall survive the expiration or  tennination of this Addendum.    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Addendum to be duly executed.

This document includes both hardware and software design considerations.  This document will not address cost, schedule, or program risk. It also gives some detail about  speciﬁcs of the design implementation.    1.1 Scope    This document covers the Carnaro project, which are Industrial Automation products. It consists of a family of 19  switches, ranging from 6 ports to 20 ports. There are four switch chassis fonn factors.    The requirements specify the behavior of the system as seen by the end user. They do not  specify "how" the system will be built except for necessary constraints on the design such as  needed interfaces to other systems or valid constraints on size, shape, processor and memory  utilization, power consumption, etc‘ The behavior may be described in terms of how the system  enables the end user to perform work (ie., the functions, performance, quality requirements, etc).    The architectural design describes the components of the system, their individual functions and  performance, and how they interface with each other.    Development considerations such as schedule, cost, development process, and staffing are not  included in a system speciﬁcation.

It is designed for interconnecting in  the manufacturing factory environment as part of Industrial Automation.    2.1 System Overview    The Camaro product family has 19 SKUs, but each SKU can be packaged with Cisco front panel  overlays, or with Rockwell front panel overlay for a total of 38 possible SKUs, which  manufacturing will have to manage. For many of these SKUs the difference is very slight, such  as a different Board ID or a different version of IOS image loaded. The following PID table was  derived from the PID table listed in the PRD, but is color coded to show which SKUs are  supported by which hardware conﬁgurations.

Camaro-Z4G supports two copper  10/100/1000Base-T ports. Camaro—Z4S supports two ﬁber 100Mb SFP ports. Camaro-Z4SG  supports two ﬁber 100Mb or 1000Mb S 3P ports. The remainder of Camaro products support  two combo ports. Combo ports support both copper and SFP interfaces, though only one  interface can be used at a time. The har ware design supports 1G uplink ports. However, in  some products this is limited to 100Mb via soﬂware. These ports support standard Ethernet  features such as forced or auto-negotiating speed and duplex, auto-MDIX, and cable diagnostics.    2.2.4.2 10/100 Ethernet Downlink Ports    Camaro supports 10/ l 00Base-T ports. "hese ports support standard Fast Ethernet features such  as forced or auto-negotiating speed and duplex, auto-MDIX, and cable diagnostics.    2.2.4.3 Extra SFP Uplink Ports    Camaro-Z16GE supports two additiona l00Base-X SFP ports providing 4 uplink ports. These  ports will not support the 1000Base SFPs.    2.2.4.4 Console Port    All Camaro SKU’s support twoconsole port connectors for management communication to the  swith via a UART interface. If a USB console cable is detected, the USB console LED will turn  on and the miniB-USB connector will be selected for console I/O. Otherwise the console I/O  defaults to the standard RS232 UART connections of the RJ45 console connector. (Thus if  cables are installed on both ports, the USB console port will take precedence.)    The USB connector will require a positive locking mechanism for the attached cable to meet the  l5N pull requirement in hazardous locations.    2.2.4.5 Alarm Inputs/Outputs    All Carnaro SKU’s support two dry contact alarm inputs and one alarm output relay. The  contacts for both input and output alarms share a common Alarm connector.    Input Alarms:    Each of the two dry contact Alarm inputs can be provisioned separately to generate an alarm  event. SW can be used to conﬁgure the alarm state as mqor or minor as well as setting the  default state as open or closed. The User will be notiﬁed via alarm messages as well as LED  indicators when an alarm triggers. The user is provided a single pin for each Alarm input as  well as an Alann Return pin on the Alarm Connector.
